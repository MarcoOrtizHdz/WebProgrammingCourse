            Alright, let’s do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker.
            I was bitten by a radioactive spider and for ten years I’ve been
            the one and only Spider-Man. I’m pretty sure you know the rest.
            I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and 
            then I saved the city again and again and again...

            Alright people. Let’s start at the beginning one last time. 
            My name is Gwen Stacy. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. 
            And for the last two years I've been the one and only 
            SpiderWoman. You guys know the rest. I joined a band. Saved 
            my dad. I couldn’t save my best friend, Peter Parker. So now 
            I save everyone else. And I don’t do friends anymore. Just to 
            avoid any distractions. And one day this weird thing happened... 
            and I mean, like, really weird.

            OK, let's do this one last time, yeah? For real this time.
            This is it. My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a 
            radioactive spider. And for like two days, I’ve been the
            one and only Spider-Man. I think you know the rest. I 
            finished my essay. I saved a bunch of people. Got hit by a 
            drone. Did this with my dad. And when I feel alone, like no 
            one understands what I’m going through, I remember my friends 
            who get it.
        </p>
